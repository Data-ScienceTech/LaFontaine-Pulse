# Analytics Collection Backend

Since we need a backend to collect analytics data from all users, here are your options:

## Option 1: Azure Functions (Recommended)
I can help you set up a simple Azure Function that:
- Receives analytics data from your site
- Stores it in Azure Table Storage or Cosmos DB
- Provides an admin API to retrieve aggregated data

## Option 2: Simple Node.js Server
Deploy a lightweight Express.js server that:
- Accepts POST requests with analytics data
- Stores data in a JSON file or database
- Serves analytics dashboard

## Option 3: Use Existing Service
- **Plausible Analytics** (privacy-focused, GDPR compliant)
- **Fathom Analytics** (simple, privacy-focused)
- **Azure Application Insights** (Microsoft's analytics service)

## Immediate Implementation: Local Collection + Export

For now, let me implement a system that:
1. Collects data locally in browser
2. Allows you to retrieve it via special admin commands
3. Can export all data as JSON
4. Later upgrade to full backend

Would you like me to:
A) Set up Azure Functions backend (15 minutes)
B) Use a third-party privacy-focused service (5 minutes)  
C) Implement local collection with export (immediate)

Let me know your preference!

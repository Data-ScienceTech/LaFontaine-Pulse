# 404 Fix for GitHub Pages Deployment

## Problem
The GitHub Pages deployment was successful, but accessing `https://carlosdenner.github.io/papineau-noise-pulse/` resulted in a 404 error.

## Root Cause
GitHub Pages doesn't natively support client-side routing (SPA routing) with React Router's `BrowserRouter`. When a user visits the site directly or refreshes a page, GitHub Pages looks for a physical file at that path, which doesn't exist for SPA routes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added 404.html Fallback
- Created `/public/404.html` that redirects to the main app
- Stores the intended path in `sessionStorage`
- Redirects to the base URL with the repository path

### 2. Updated Router Configuration
- Added `basename="/papineau-noise-pulse"` to `BrowserRouter` in `App.tsx`
- This tells React Router about the GitHub Pages subdirectory

### 3. Added Redirect Handling
- Updated `index.html` to check for stored redirect paths
- Restores the intended URL using `history.replaceState()`

### 4. How It Works
1. User visits `https://carlosdenner.github.io/papineau-noise-pulse/some-route`
2. GitHub Pages serves `404.html` (since `/some-route` doesn't exist)
3. `404.html` stores `/some-route` in sessionStorage and redirects to base URL
4. Main app loads and checks sessionStorage
5. App navigates to the original intended route

## Files Changed
- ✅ `/public/404.html` - New fallback page
- ✅ `/src/App.tsx` - Added basename to BrowserRouter
- ✅ `/index.html` - Added redirect handling script

## Result
- Clean URLs without hash routing
- Direct URL access works correctly
- Page refreshes work as expected
- Maintains React Router functionality

## Test After Deployment
Wait for the GitHub Actions deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes), then test:
- https://carlosdenner.github.io/papineau-noise-pulse/ (should work)
- Refresh the page (should still work)
- Direct navigation should work seamlessly

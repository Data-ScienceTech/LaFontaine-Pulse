# Next Steps for GitHub Pages Deployment

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] All code changes pushed to GitHub repository
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow configured
- [x] Build process optimized for GitHub Pages
- [x] All documentation updated
- [x] Local build tested and working

## üìã Manual Steps Required

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (if not already done)
1. Go to https://github.com/carlosdenner/papineau-noise-pulse/settings/pages
2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
3. Save the settings

### 2. Monitor Deployment
1. Check the GitHub Actions tab: https://github.com/carlosdenner/papineau-noise-pulse/actions
2. Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Ensure it completes successfully

### 3. Verify Live Site
Once deployment is complete, visit: https://carlosdenner.github.io/papineau-noise-pulse/

## üîç Troubleshooting

If the deployment fails:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. Verify the workflow has proper permissions (should be set automatically)
3. Ensure the repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)

## üìù Additional Options

### Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `public/` directory with your domain
2. Update the `vite.config.ts` base path accordingly
3. Configure DNS settings at your domain provider

### Analytics Enhancement (Optional)
The app includes privacy-compliant analytics:
- Currently stores data locally
- Ready for Azure Application Insights integration
- See `src/lib/azureStorage.ts` for implementation

## üöÄ Expected Result

The LaFontaine Noise Pulse web app should be live at:
**https://carlosdenner.github.io/papineau-noise-pulse/**

The site will show:
- Real-time noise level monitoring
- EV adoption estimates
- Interactive charts and data visualization
- Responsive design optimized for all devices

# Asset Loading Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## Problem Identified ✅

The LaFontaine Noise Pulse site is now loading (GitHub Pages is configured!), but the browser is getting 404 errors for CSS and JavaScript files.

## Root Cause

**Asset file name mismatch** - The browser is trying to load old asset files:
- `vendor-BAauGlvZ.js` ❌ (doesn't exist)
- `index-CeClv63m.js` ❌ (doesn't exist)  
- `ui-Ce2_nxKZ.js` ❌ (doesn't exist)

But the current build has different file names:
- `vendor-DEEXKb7g.js` ✅ (exists)
- `index-DJngGq1V.js` ✅ (exists)
- `ui-Bm6oD_UM.js` ✅ (exists)

## Why This Happened

Vite generates unique file names based on content hashes. The deployed version was from an earlier build with different file names than the current build.

## Solution Applied ✅

1. **Triggered fresh deployment** by making a commit
2. **New GitHub Actions workflow** will build with current file names
3. **Asset references will match** the actual files

## Expected Timeline

- ⏱️ **Deployment**: 2-3 minutes
- ✅ **Result**: All assets will load correctly
- 🎯 **Live site**: https://data-sciencetech.github.io/LaFontaine-Pulse/

## Monitor Progress

Check deployment status: https://github.com/Data-ScienceTech/LaFontaine-Pulse/actions

Once the new deployment completes, refresh the site and all assets should load properly!
